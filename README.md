Adjustabike is the concept of an open source build your own bike kit. It is made of standard aluminium tubes and custom attachments you can assemble the way you like. It comes with two predefined frame geometries you can switch from, city and cargo, but the idea is that you can develop any standard or exotic bicycle frame out of it!

Advantages of the concept:
* **Material efficiency**. All parts are reusable since the assembly does not use any destructive processes. No drills, all joints are made by clamping elements. You can use the same parts to switch from one geometry to another
* **High flexibility**: you can adapt or completely change the geometry whenever you like. Commuting on the morning and going for a ride on the afternoon? Just adapt the geometry from a more comfy to a more sporty one. Doing the groceries yesterday and going on a tete-a-tete trip with your partner tomorrow? Just change from cargo to tandem! 
* **Easy assembly**. All you need to assemble a bicycle frame is a hex key. No complicated tooling, no rigs, just one simple tool.

Although we investigated the technical feasibility of this design and know it would work, Adjustabike is still just a concept for now. Feel free to bring it to the next step! We'd love to see lots of them on the streets in the future.
