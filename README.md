# Adjustabike
Final year university project to design an open source build your own bike, adjustable for both use and rider.

The bike comes as a kit, allowing the user to easily assemble the frame with minimal tooling and adjust for their specific needs. Designs have been made which allow transitions to a cargo layout with plans for a full family of layouts and joints to be developed.

This is a repository for CAD files and other relating material useful to the project.
